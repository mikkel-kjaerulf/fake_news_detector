# fake_news_detector
## Running the notebook
explore.ipynb is a notebook documenting our exploratory data analysis. main.ipynb documents our 
main cleaning, preprocessing and model training/evalutaion pipeline.

## Strcture of workspace
We structured our workspace so that all data was read and written to a folder called "data". In this folder we kept the fake news copus which was named "data/news_cleaned_2018_02_13-1.csv". Likewise, we kept the liar data set in a folder called "liar".
