# fake_news_detector
## Running the notebook
explore.ipynb is a notebook documenting our exploratory data analysis. main.ipynb documents our 
main cleaning, preprocessing and model training/evalutaion pipeline.

## Structure of workspace
We structured our workspace so that all data was read and written to a folder called "data". In this folder we kept the fake news copus which was named "data/news_cleaned_2018_02_13-1.csv". Likewise, we kept the liar data set in a folder called "liar". 

## Requirements 
We have included a "requirements.txt" which should cover all requirements. We have tested this on all our computers so this should work as intended. However, when we initially created this file during the first few weeks of the project there were a few problems, so in the event that it does not work properly one would need to manually run "pip install" for all the requirements listed in the file.
